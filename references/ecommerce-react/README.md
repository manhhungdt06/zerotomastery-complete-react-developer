# Zero to Mastery - React Course (Master Project)

:recycle: This repo is an upgraded version of the master projct in this course [This course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/).

I finished this course 2 years ago. But I'm going through it again to refresh on some of the materials tought in the course.
But also creating a reference in both "Class" and "Functional" way of doing things in React just to understand the differences better, and be able to convert to React hooks easier.
