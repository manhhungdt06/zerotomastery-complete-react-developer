# Zero to Mastery React Course

This repo was used to track my progress through the Zero to Mastery: Complete React Developer in 2020 course. The course taught me key concepts about using React, and also other React features like React Hooks and Context API. Other tools that were used throughout the course include Redux, NodeJS, the Stripe API, GraphQL, Apollo, and Firebase.

The course taught all these concepts and tools by helping implement a clothing marketplace called Crwn Clothing. The main functionality of the application was logging in using OAuth or an email and password, being able to add items to a cart, being able to modify cart items, and allowing users to checkout.
